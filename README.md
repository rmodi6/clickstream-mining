# Clickstream Mining with Decision Trees
The project is based on a task posed in KDD Cup 2000. It involves mining click-stream data collected from Gazelle.com, 
which sells legware products. The task is to determine: Given a set of page views, will the visitor view another page 
on the site or will he leave?  
The data set has discretized numerical values obtained by partitioning them into 5 intervals of equal frequency. 
This way, we get a data set where for each feature, we have a finite set of values. These values are mapped to 
integers, so that the data is easier to handle.
